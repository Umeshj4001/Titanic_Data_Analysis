# Titanic Data Analysis Streamlit App

ðŸš€ Building a Data-Driven Titanic Survival Analysis App with Streamlit ðŸš€

I'm excited to share a hands-on project where I developed an interactive data visualization web app using Python's Streamlit framework. ðŸ“ˆâœ¨

ðŸ“‚ Dataset: The iconic Titanic dataset (passenger info, age, gender, class, survival status)
ðŸ’» Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

ðŸ”Ž Key Highlights:
âœ… Data Cleaning â€“ Removed irrelevant features like Ticket, Fare, and Cabin
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Converted Gender and Embarked columns to numeric values for better analysis
âœ… Missing Value Imputation â€“ Smart filling of missing Age values based on survival status
âœ… Insightful Visualizations â€“

Gender distribution pie chart
Survival rate comparison (male vs. female)
Seaborn count plot showing survival impact by gender
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: To explore factors influencing passenger survival and demonstrate how data wrangling & visualization can bring hidden stories to light.

ðŸ“Š Outcome: A clean, interactive dashboard that allows users to understand survival patterns and the impact of demographics on survival chances.
